    <p class="info2">Applying to rent an apartment in Williamsburg, or anywhere in NYC can be a hard and chaotic process to start with strict landlords and competition in the housing market. Here is the information you'll need to make this process easier.</p>
    
  <h3>Deciding Your Budget and Area</h3>
  <p class="info2">Deciding on what you can afford is a very important step to take in this process. You do not want to spend your time looking at places that are out of your price range. You have to find the neighborhood that fulfill requirements and within your budget. </p>
  <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <p class="info2"> Here are the list of documents that are required to rent an apartment besides the information to fill the application .</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pay Stubs</li>
      <li>Letter of Employment</li>
      <li>Letter of Recommendation from previous landlord(not always a requirement,but good to have)</li>
      <li>Tax Returns</li>
      <li>Bank statements</li>
      <li>Photo ID</li>
      <li>Good Credit Score</li>

    <h3> Don't Have A Good Credit Score?</h3>
    <p class="info2"> The average credit score that most landlords qualify as a good credit score is 650 and more. If your credit score is low, there are a few things you could do to still be able to apply to rent an apartment.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Find someone with a good credit score and income to co-sign 
      </li>
      <p>Having someone to co-sign assures the landlord of your responsibility financially.It guarantees that the rent will be payed. Learn about co-signing before doing so.</p> <a href="https://homeguides.sfgate.com/cosigning-apartment-lease-affect-credit-41318.html">Does Co-Signing Affect My Credit</a>
      <hr>
      
      <li>Private Landlords</li>
      <p>Since private landlords own the property they are putting out for rent, their rules and requirements could be more flexible. Not all private landlords necessarily look at credit score.</p>
      <li>Income Statements</li>
      <p> Showing income statments could change your situations because it will further on support your financial stability.</p>
    </ul>
    
    <h3> Closing the Deal</h3>
    <p class="info2"> After you submit your application for the apartment you want and get accepted, sign the lease. Read over the lease attentively and address the landlords with any concerns you have. Lastly, schedule your move in.
